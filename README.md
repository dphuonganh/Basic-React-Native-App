# Basic-React-Native-App

## Mission

You have to develop a React Native app that will work in both iOS and Android platforms. For convenience we are only going to test the app in iOS iphone simulator. Your app will query a local json file and create a list of movies that are voted as top 10 movies of all time in IMDB.


## IMDB Top 10 movies

This is the list of movies voted as the top 10 movies in IMDB by the users. The following is the link

https://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=drama&groups=top_250&sort=user_rating,desc

Our app is going to display the top 10 movies in IMDB by fetching the json data given in the local file. You can find the local json file attached to this project.
