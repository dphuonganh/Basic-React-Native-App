# Basic-React-Native-App

## Mission

You have to develop a React Native app that will work in both iOS and Android platforms. For convenience we are only going to test the app in iOS iphone simulator. Your app will query a local json file and create a list of movies that are voted as top 10 movies of all time in IMDB.


## IMDB Top 10 movies

This is the list of movies voted as the top 10 movies in IMDB by the users. The following is the link

https://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=drama&groups=top_250&sort=user_rating,desc

Our app is going to display the top 10 movies in IMDB by fetching the json data given in the local file. You can find the local json file attached to this project.


## Prerequisite

We assume that you have react native installed in your PC's. But for students whose PC doesn't have react native. You need to follow the procedures step by step to get react installed.

## ReactNative

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. 

You can learn more about ReactNative by reading and understanding the official docs

## Practicing with ReactNative
You can practice your ReactNative code using an online code editor. The following code editors are popular with developers and you may use them to practice your react native code.

## The App

The Following is the screenshot of the app which shows the top ten movies of IMDB using a scrollable view.

## Waypoint 1: Create a skeleton React Native app

Create a basic React Native app that displays a text or an image.

## Waypoint 2: Parse JSON file

Fetch information from parsed data

## WayPoint 3: Create stylish components

Create a stylish component that will hold each movies in the album.

## WayPoint 4: Create movie components

Pass the fetched JSON data into stylish movie components.

## WayPoint 5: Create Album

Create an album using the individual movie components and display them in a stylized scroll view.

## WayPoint 6: Touchable Component

Create a touchable component (eg. A button is a touchable component) in each movie component so that when the user taps into the button it will open the corresponding url of the movie in a web browser. The following is the url opening up to the corresponding movie page in IMDB when the button is tapped.

## Common Errors

It's highly likely that you will face multitude of errors when working with ReactNative. Most of the errors have been documented and some of the errors can be traced back to your wrong codes. Make sure you make your app bug free and your app work smoothly.

## Local JSON file

You can download the JSON file required for this project below.
